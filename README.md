## 💡 Best Practices

### 1. Always Start with a PRP
Never skip the PRP generation - it ensures:
- Complete requirement understanding
- Proper agent assignment
- Clear validation gates
- One-pass implementation success

### 2. Trust the Agent Specialization
Each agent is expert in their domain:
- Don't have HubSpot specialist write payment code
- Don't have Stripe specialist write infrastructure
- Let each agent own their expertise

### 3. Maintain the Checkpoint System
Daily checkpoints ensure:
- No lost context between sessions
- Clear progress tracking
- Quick onboarding for new sessions
- Complete audit trail

### 4. Use HubSpot Properties for Everything
State management principles:
- No local databases
- No session storage
- No file-based state
- Everything in HubSpot properties

### 5. Implement Idempotency Everywhere
Every operation must be:
- Safe to retry
- Safe to run multiple times
- Properly tracked with unique IDs
- Recoverable from any failure point

  1. Add more detail to feature requirements
  2. Include specific examples
  3. Define clear success criteria
  4. Reference existing patterns
```

#### Agent Coordination Issues
```yaml
Problem: Agent handoff confusion
Solution:
  1. Check AGENT_DEVELOPER_COORDINATION_RULES.md
  2. Ensure interface contracts are defined
  3. Use HANDOFF comments in code
  4. Review dependency chain
```

#### HubSpot API Limits
```yaml
Problem: 429 rate limit errors
Solution:
  1. Implement exponential backoff
  2. Use batch operations
  3. Cache read operations
  4. Spread requests over time
```

#### Vercel Timeout Issues
```yaml
Problem: Function execution exceeds 60 seconds
